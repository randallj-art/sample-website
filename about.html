        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p> Hi! My name is Randall Johanningsmeier, and I am an artist currently based in Omaha, Nebraska. I primarily make oil paintings, but I often experiment with other media and methods such as drawing, acrylic painting, and quilting. I am particularly inspired by mathematics and architecture, and my work often investigates and plays with these themes. I recently graduated from Swarthmore College with degrees in studio art and mathematics, and now I am working hard in my Omaha studio, beginning to build up a body of work. Outside of my studio practice, I enjoy reading, playing the guitar, acting, and bowling.</p>
